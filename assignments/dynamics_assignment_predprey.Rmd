## PART 1

Lotka-volterra with hunting function:

I added the hunting rate conditional on a minimum prey population. Hunting will only occur when there is at least a `minprey` amount of prey, and it is added to the equation as a hunting rate multiplied by the prey population.

```{r}
source(here::here("assignments", "lotvmod-hunt.R"))

```

## PART 2

Sobol Sensitivity Analysis

```{r}
# set standard parameter values
rprey <- 0.95
alpha <- 0.01
eff <- 0.6
pmort <- 0.4
K <- 2000
minprey <- 0.6 * K
```
